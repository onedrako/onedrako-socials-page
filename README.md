Hello World üê≤
-----------------------Why does this project exist?---------------------------------

Project to make an introduction and information to my hobby in social network, specifically on twitch and discord.

It has been created because i need to put some information about the streams in twitch for my people, for example about the stream, new content, the discord that we have to communicate. 

-------------------------Features---------------------------

The first idea was to put the games of the week that we were going to play, but now the first feature is to add a form to all the people in discord can be able to introduce themselves for all the community. For the moment only this is working https://onedrako-page.vercel.app/discord/huellita

-------------------------Technologies I am using---------------------------
I used the library React and styled Componentes to add styles, it is not necessary at all using the library React but it is a good practice to me to use it. I built this project previously using HTML, Style and JS Vanilla.
To manage routes I used the library react-router-dom.

To format the code I used the standard with Eslint.
I used NPM to install and manage the packages.
To bundle the code in a single file, I used Webpack and babel to Compile the code JS and JSX .

To create forms im using the library Formik and Yup.
To Test it im using the library Jest. 


This project is still in progress. üòÑ
